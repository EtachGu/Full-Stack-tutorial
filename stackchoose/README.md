## Things to Consider When Choosing a Software Stack
The bottom line when you’re choosing a stack is thinking ahead. Here are some questions to ask before you pick your stack:

- **What’s your minimum viable product (MVP), and how much do you see it growing?** Your MVP is the core set of deliverables you need to get your website deployed—highest return on investment vs. lowest risk. Whatever parameters you have for your website or web application MVP is a good place to start when choosing a stack—then, it can grow from there.

- **Scalability** is incredibly important if you see your site or application growing, and a solid stack from the start means a solid foundation. Growth can be vertical, with more programs and processes included in your application, or horizontal, requiring it to run on more machines. It all boils down to solid code and a strong foundation. If growth is in your future, pick a stack that can accommodate a lot of growth without collapsing.

- **What are your development team’s strengths?** Programming languages and frameworks are one part of a stack, but they do tend to impart their “flavor” on the stack as a whole. If your team has been working with PHP for a long time, a PHP-based stack like LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) or one of its variants is a good place to start. It’s an automatic time-saver.

- **What platform is best for your project?** Whether it’s the .NET platform, the Java Platform, or Node.js, every platform has its own strengths. There’s no “best” platform—just the best one for your project. This question has a few sub-questions:

- **How important is speed to your stack choice?** Node.js is a great choice for speed and scalability. Add to that the fact that it’s written in JavaScript, which makes it fast and universal, and it’s clear why LinkedIn moved from the Ruby platform to Node.js. Another thing to consider is developer time vs. runtime. It’s a general rule of thumb that what speed you gain in development you make up for in runtime, and vice versa.

For example: .NET and Java both include compilers—programs that convert language code into machine code, so computers can process them—but require a lot more baseline code to be written up front in the project. Node.js allows developers to create more complexity with less code up front, but it doesn’t include a compiler, so you’ll need an experienced developer to ensure the code is clean. Again, the most important thing is how well the code is written so that it can be adaptable in the future. Explore more about these platforms in our Java article, our .NET Platform article, and our guide to Node.js.

- **Is cost a big factor?** Cost is a pretty open-ended aspect and hard to predict, but things like licenses, the cost to hire developers who know more obscure languages, hours spent in development, and future cost to maintain are all things to consider. For example, .NET code may take longer to write but is easier to debug in the future if problems occur.

- **What database is best for your project?**

How you structure your data is central to choosing your stack. For example, if you opt to go with a NoSQL database, you’ll want to choose other components that are most compatible with that database format.

Keep long-term maintenance and security on your radar. It’s always possible to update parts of a stack with some reconfiguration, but there’s nothing more efficient than a solid foundation. Longer code takes more time to process, while shorter, more concise code can sometimes be cryptic and harder to debug.
