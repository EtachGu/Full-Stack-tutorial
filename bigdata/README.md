# Data Ingestion, data management, ETL and warehouse

The process of importing, transferring, loading and processing data for later use or storage in a database is called Data ingestion and this involves loading data from a variety of sources, altering and modification of individual files and formatting them to fit into a larger document.

Data ingestion can be continuous, asynchronous, real-time or batched and the source and the destination may also have different format or protocol, which will require some type of transformation or conversion.
